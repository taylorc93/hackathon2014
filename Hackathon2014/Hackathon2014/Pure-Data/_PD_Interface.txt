Pure Data Interface

Master List of Receivers
Last Updated 1/17/15

Main Patch: Master.pd

Interface is divided into two distinct sections: Master patch & 
		Dynamic subpatches (channels).

MASTER:

FROM Main Patch: (add a receiver to listen to the values)
	NOTE_COUNT: the current count of notes that have been created by PD

TO Main Patch:

	[reset]    bang   # Reset Everything
	[add_note] bang   # Add a note
	[all] 	   message   	# Message to send to all notes at once

	Master Audio Effects: 		# These will be applied to everything

	[pregain_on]     1 / 0
	[pregain_amount] float 
	[ringmod_on] 	 1 / 0
	[ringmod_rate]   float
	[ringmod_depth]  float (0-1)
	[filter_on]      1 / 0
	[filter_freq]    float (0-22050, Hz)
	[filter_q]       float (0-5ish)
	[delay_on]       1 / 0
	[delay_time] 	 float (Time in ms)
	[delay_feedback] float (0-1)
	[chorus_on] 	 1 / 0
	[chorus_rate] 	 float
	[chorus_depth] 	 float (0-1 usually, >1 gives cool effects)
	[chorus_mix]  	 float (0-100)
	[tremolo_on] 	 1 / 0
	[tremolo_rate]   float
	[tremolo_depth]  float (0-1)
	[tremolo_shape]  float (0-3)
	[vibrato_on] 	 1 / 0 (Vibrato is still a little buggy sometimes)
	[vibrato_rate]   float
	[vibrato_depth]  float (0-1)
	[gain_on] 		 1 / 0
	[gain_amount]    float
	[panner_on] 	 1 / 0
	[panner_rate] 	 float 
	[panner_depth] 	 float (0-1)

	[volume] 		 float (1-0)		# Master Volume Control
	[pan] 			 float (0-100) 		# Master Pan Control

To Individual Note (Dynamically Created):

	Send messages (or lists) to the receiver:

		channel#

	where the # is the note number to send the messages to.

	Sending "note 60 60" to "channel1" triggers the note on channel1 to play the MIDI note 60.

	Effects methods are always prepended with "fx".

	Example:

		note 60 5
		note 60 0
		pitchbend_range 24
		pitchbend 20
		fx gain_on 1
		fx gain_amount .8

		wave 7
		fx tremolo_on 1

	Meaning: 

		Turn note 60 on and off. Set the pitchbend range to 2 octaves,
		and set the pitchbend value to 20 (shifting it down by 64 - 20 
		semitones). Set gain controls on and set gain value to 0.8

		Set waveform to 7, turn tremolo on.

		Vibrato is in both amplitude and pitch, and both these aspects
		are important for a good instrument.  To use pitch vibrato, send
		pitchbend messages to the note.  To use volume vibrato, turn the
		gain unit on initially using "fx gain_on 1" and change it's value 
		using "fx gain_amount #" where the amount goes from 0 - 1.

	Send notes to different channels by using different receivers:

		[channel#] where # is the channel number.

	Example:

		[channel3] release 400
		[channel3] fx delay_time 1000
		[channel3] fx delay_feedback .8
		[channel3] flush

	Meaning:

		Set following settings for Channel 3:

			400 ms release time
			1 second delay time
			delay coefficient of 0.8
			Flush all Notes in channel 3.

		Note that there have to be at least three channels created through
		[add_note] for this message to have any meaning.

	Notes currently have the exact same effects as the master, in terms of
	both the names and the designs.  All the effects documented in master 
	will work individually for each note through the list & receiver 
	interface as defined above.

	All Note Methods:

		note
		wave
		attack
		decay
		sustain
		release
		flush
		pitchbend
		pitchbend_range
		volume_bend
		volume_bend_default
		print 					# Prints ADSR output to console
		fx pregain_on
		fx pregain_amount
		fx ringmod_on
		fx ringmod_rate
		fx ringmod_depth
		fx filter_on
		fx filter_freq
		fx filter_q
		fx delay_on
		fx delay_time
		fx delay_feedback
		fx chorus_on
		fx chorus_rate
		fx chorus_depth
		fx chorus_mix
		fx tremolo_on
		fx tremolo_rate
		fx tremolo_depth
		fx tremolo_shape
		fx vibrato_on
