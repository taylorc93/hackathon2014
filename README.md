# Tufts Hackathon Fall 2014 Project

### By Connor Taylor and Chris Penny

This repository contains the iOS app that was built for the Tufts Fall 2014 Hackathon.  This app allows users to make their own instrument interface by adding, moving, and deleting customizable notes.  Basic audio effects can also be applied.

## NOTE: This app is currently under heavy development.  Expect things to be changing constantly.

### Current Functionality:

1. Play notes via tap or swipe in play mode
2. Select, deselect, or delete notes in edit mode
3. Chorus, Tremelo, and Ring Modulation effects
4. Add new notes with customizable pitch and octave
5. Can adjust wave form for all waves

### Todo

1. Handle multitouch smoothly
2. Make notes more customizable
3. Reset button
4. More preset note configurations
5. Figure out octave color scheme
6. Slideable panels for settings and effects
